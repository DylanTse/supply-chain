# supply-chain
### Problem Statement:
Small-sized businesses that are new or are creating new relationships with suppliers need a secure and centralized way to track shipping charges and supplies bought because keeping track between multiple suppliers, distributors, and shippers is cumbersome and can result in errors.

### Solution:
A distributed ledger web-app where any changes/transaction additions have to be validated by every “person” with database access.
